# Access tiers

There are three access tiers

- **Hot** → Optimised for frequent access. High storage costs but low access costs. New accounts are in the hot tier by default.
- **Cool** → Optimised for large amounts of data which are accessed infrequently and stored for at least 30 days. Low storage costs, high access costs.
- **Archive** (only available for block blobs) → Optimised for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency, will remain for 180 days. Most cost-effective storage but very high access costs.
