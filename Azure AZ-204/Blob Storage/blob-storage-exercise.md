# Blob Storage Exercise

The exercise in the [training documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/work-azure-blob-storage/4-develop-blob-storage-dotnet) went through building a quick app to display some of the tools that you can do using Blob Storage (in C#).

The steps were:

1. Creating a container
2. Uploading blobs to that container
3. Proving that the blobs were in the container by listing the blobs in that container
4. Accessing that blob by downloading it (and changing the file name for the downloaded one)
5. Cleaning up and deleting the container (and therefore the blob) and the downloaded file.

### Notes/remarks

I could see in the portal that the container had been made in the storage account. (had to make a resource group and storage account beforehand).
Made the azure resources from the CLI.
